# Read Me

**gatsby4mdx is my personal starter and sandbox. Clone it and use as you see fit at your own peril ;-)**

This starter implements a lot of the patterns that I have observed and implemented in numerous corporate websites. 



The site has the following features:

- Uses [Gatsby 4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) 4 as a Static Site Generator. 
- Default page template uses a sectioned layout. Inspiration came from the MAN, Stackbit's [Simon Hanukaev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smnh/) 
- Page transitions are implemented with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). Inspiration came from [Ryan Wiemer's Github repo](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-using-page-transitions)
- Section animations are implemented with [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/)
- All stying is done with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
